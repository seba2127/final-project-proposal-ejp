<h2> Ideas </h2>

<p2> I am doing this project alone. I will be making a program that the user can play rock paper scissors agaisnt the computer. I 
will call Robot V. Human. The user will play rock, paper, scisors against the computer by inputing their choice. I will be using Python 
to run this program. I will try to use what we used during the love tester to try to make this work. If I have enough time I can try to 
put this on a website where they can play against the computer.
